A* Search

Given: 
    Map
    Starting location
    Goal location
    Cost

Goal:
    Find minimum cost path

The A* algorithm finds a path from the start node to the end node by 
checking for open neighbors of the current node, computing a heuristic 
for each of the neighbors, and adding those neighbors to the list of open nodes 
to explore next. The next node to explore is the one with the lowest total cost + heuristic (g + h). 
This process is repeated until the end is found, as long as there are still open nodes to explore. 

const promises not to modify a variable, even though the variable can only be evaluated at run time.
constexpr guarantees that a variable can be evaluated at compile time.

The distinction between const and constexpr is subtle.
In general, though, const is much more common than constexpr.
When in doubt, use const, especially to guard against accidentally modifying a variable.
