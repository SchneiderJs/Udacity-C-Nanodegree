Header files, or .h files, allow related function, method, and class declarations to be collected in one place. 
The corresponding definitions can then be placed in .cpp files. The compiler considers a header declaration a "promise" that 
the definition will be found later in the code, so if the compiler reaches a function that hasn't been defined yet, it can continue 
on compiling until the definition is found. This allows functions to be defined (and declared) in arbitrary order.

A C++ pointer is just a variable that stores the memory address of an object in your program.
Pointers give you better control over how your program uses memory. 

Pointers and references can have similar use cases in C++. As seen previously both references and pointers can be 
used in pass-by-reference to a function. Additionally, they both provide an alternative way to access an existing variable: 
pointers through the variable's address, and references through another name for that variable.
